/*
 * Mastermind is a game of two players. In the beginning, first player decides
a secret key, which is a sequence (s1,s2,...sk) where 0 < si <= n, Then
second player makes guesses in rounds, where each guess is of form (g1,g2, .
..gk), and after each guess first player calculates the score for the guess.
Score for a guess is equal to number of i's for which we have gi = si.

For example if the secret key is (4,2,5,3,1) and the guess is (1,2,3,7,1),
then the score is 2, because g2 = s2 and g5 = s5.

Given a sequence of guesses, and scores for each guess, your program must
decide if there exists at least one secret key that generates those exact
scores.
