Facebook Chat
By Eugene Letuchy on Tuesday, May 13, 2008 at 9:56pm
One of the things I like most about working at Facebook is the ability to launch products that are (almost) immediately used by millions of people. Unlike a three-guys-in-a-garage startup, we don't have the luxury of scaling out infrastructure to keep pace with user growth; when your feature's userbase will go from 0 to 70 million practically overnight, scalability has to be baked in from the start. The project I'm currently working on, Facebook Chat, offered a nice set of software engineering challenges:

Real-time presence notification:

The most resource-intensive operation performed in a chat system is not sending messages. It is rather keeping each online user aware of the online-idle-offline states of their friends, so that conversations can begin.

The naive implementation of sending a notification to all friends whenever a user comes online or goes offline has a worst case cost of O(average friendlist size * peak users * churn rate) messages/second, where churn rate is the frequency with which users come online and go offline, in events/second. This is wildly inefficient to the point of being untenable, given that the average number of friends per user is measured in the hundreds, and the number of concurrent users during peak site usage is on the order of several millions.

Surfacing connected users' idleness greatly enhances the chat user experience but further compounds the problem of keeping presence information up-to-date. Each Facebook Chat user now needs to be notified whenever one of his/her friends 
(a) takes an action such as sending a chat message or loads a Facebook page (if tracking idleness via a last-active timestamp) or 
(b) transitions between idleness states (if representing idleness as a state machine with states like "idle-for-1-minute", "idle-for-2-minutes", "idle-for-5-minutes", "idle-for-10-minutes", etc.). 
Note that approach (a) changes the sending a chat message / loading a Facebook page from a one-to-one communication into a multicast to all online friends, while approach (b) ensures that users who are neither chatting nor browsing Facebook are nonetheless generating server load.

Real-time messaging:

Another challenge is ensuring the timely delivery of the messages themselves. The method we chose to get text from one user to another involves loading an iframe on each Facebook page, and having that iframe's Javascript make an HTTP GET request over a persistent connection that doesn't return until the server has data for the client. The request gets reestablished if it's interrupted or times out. This isn't by any means a new technique: it's a variation of Comet, specifically XHR long polling, and/or BOSH.

Having a large-number of long-running concurrent requests makes the Apache part of the standard LAMP stack a dubious implementation choice. Even without accounting for the sizeable overhead of spawning an OS process that, on average, twiddles its thumbs for a minute before reporting that no one has sent the user a message, the waiting time could be spent servicing 60-some requests for regular Facebook pages. The result of running out of Apache processes over the entire Facebook web tier is not pretty, nor is the dynamic configuration of the Apache process limits enjoyable.

Distribution, Isolation, and Failover:

Fault tolerance is a desirable characteristic of any big system: if an error happens, the system should try its best to recover without human intervention before giving up and informing the user. The results of inevitable programming bugs, hardware failures, et al., should be hidden from the user as much as possible and isolated from the rest of the system.

The way this is typically accomplished in a web application is by separating the model and the view: data is persisted in a database (perhaps with a separate in-memory cache), with each short-lived request retrieving only the parts relevant to that request. Because the data is persisted, a failed read request can be re-attempted. Cache misses and database failure can be detected by the non-database layers and either reported to the user or worked around using replication.

While this architecture works pretty well in general, it isn't as successful in a chat application due to the high volume of long-lived requests, the non-relational nature of the data involved, and the statefulness of each request.

For Facebook Chat, we rolled our own subsystem for logging chat messages (in C++) as well as an epoll-driven web server (in Erlang) that holds online users' conversations in-memory and serves the long-polled HTTP requests. Both subsystems are clustered and partitioned for reliability and efficient failover. Why Erlang? In short, because the problem domain fits Erlang like a glove. Erlang is a functional concurrency-oriented language with extremely low-weight user-space "processes", share-nothing message-passing semantics, built-in distribution, and a "crash and recover" philosophy proven by two decades of deployment on large soft-realtime production systems.

Glueing with Thrift:

Despite those advantages, using Erlang for a component of Facebook Chat had a downside: that component needed to communicate with the other parts of the system. Glueing together PHP, Javascript, Erlang, and C++ is not a trivial matter. Fortunately, we have Thrift. Thrift translates a service description into the RPC glue code necessary for making cross-language calls (marshalling arguments and responses over the wire) and has templates for servers and clients. Since going open source a year ago (we had the gall to release it on April Fool's Day, 2007), the Thrift project has steadily grown and improved (with multiple iterations on the Erlang binding). Having Thrift available freed us to split up the problem of building a chat system and use the best available tool to approach each sub-problem. 

Ramping up:

The secret for going from zero to seventy million users overnight is to avoid doing it all in one fell swoop. We chose to simulate the impact of many real users hitting many machines by means of a "dark launch" period in which Facebook pages would make connections to the chat servers, query for presence information and simulate message sends without a single UI element drawn on the page. With the "dark launch" bugs fixed, we hope that you enjoy Facebook Chat now that the UI lights have been turned on.

https://www.quora.com/Why-didnt-Facebook-Chat-Message-use-XMPP-Jabber-like-other-IMs
XMPP is an awful and heavyweight protocol (streaming XML?;). It's spec is so big that there is no complete implementation of it. The most complete and most scalable implementation is ejabberd. But because XMPP was designed in dotcom era, it's not a good fit for modern Web-scale Internet and mobile companies. Even that ejabberd is de-facto open-source XMPP server, you can't take stock ejabberd and use it for Web-scale application.

90% of messaging companies either use heavily customized version of ejabberd (WhatsApp, APNs - Apple Push Notification servers) or developed custom Erlang servers for more scalability and mobile friendly protocols, either proprietary or standard such as MQTT.


Facebook Chat was initially written in Erlang/OTP using custom long-polling protocols and later re-written in C++ for political/HR reasons. It also used ejabberd as a gateway to outside XMPP networks.

Facebook Messenger (ex Beluga group chat app) uses MQTT - which is mobile and battery-friendly lightweight pubsub protocol. MQTT is being standardized by OASIS as a communication protocol for Internet of Things and Machine-to-Macine (M2M) applications.

Facebook: Design High-Frequency
关于面试流程
社招的话
电面1-2轮，一般就是coding
onsite一般是4轮，2轮coding，1轮design，1轮behavior+coding
校招的话，那轮design也变成coding了



关于准备
1) algo/coding
建议大家刷一下leetcode，基本上cover到了大多数常见面试题，而且有可能碰到原题
。需要注意的是，仅仅解出来可能是不够的。代码的质量和速度也非常重要。网上有一
些别人给出的答案可以参考，尽量做到代码简洁清晰。速度上leetcode上所有题都做到
10分钟以内写完。


2) design
解这种题是个*交流*的过程，或者说是给出方案然后获取反馈的不断循环的过程。一般
的流程：首先你要问清楚requirement；然后可以讲一下high level architecture，就
是分成哪几个component，互相之间如果interact，在白板上画一画；之后面试官可能
会让你深入某个component detail讨论；也有可能变换requirement让你重新设计
另外，f家还喜欢让你估算机器之类的，做一些back-of-envelopme calculation。所以
最好对一些计算机相关的基本常数，fb的用户量等等有个大概的了解。

准备的时候建议看看fb的design高频题。一方面有可能面试的时候刚好碰到这几个
topic，另一方面其实很多design都是相通的。

-----------
(1) design a URL shortener service
(2) On a given array with N numbers, find subset of size M (exactly M elements) that equal to SUM.

(3) Design a data structure that supports kind of full text search but in numbers. 

We are given file with lot of 10-digits numbers, for example: 

1234 567 890 
4124 123 123 
3123 123 322 

On a given number X we should return all numbers that contain X. 

For example, if the number 123 was given, we should return all numbers (from the list above) because 123 is in all of them. 

If the number 41 was given we should return only the middle number - because the number 41 is only in it.

Given an array of contacts with phone numbers/emails you should detect and union identical contacts. 

For example, given the following contacts array: 

[ [ "John", "john@gmail.com", "john@fb.com"], 
[ "Dan", "dan@gmail.com", "+1234567"], 
[ "john123", "+5412312", "john123@skype.com"], 
[ "john1985", "+5412312", "john@fb.com"] ] 

We can see that john1985, John and john123 are the same person by their contact information. 

We should output 

[[ 0, 2, 3], [1]] (0,2,3 are the same person and 1 is another one)

(5) Given a singly linked list, swap the list items in pairs (reconnect the pointers, not simply swap the values). For example: 

Before: A->B->C->D 
After: B->A->D->C

(6) Given an m x n matrix where each row element is sorted, but the columns do not appear in sorted order, write a function to print each matrix element in sorted order. 

Example matrix: 
matrix = [ 
[20, 40, 80], 
[5, 60, 90], 
[45, 50, 55] 
] 

Your function should print 5, 20, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 80, 90. 

Add on: Assume that we are space-constrained such that we can only hold one row in memory at a time. Optimize your function to work under such constraints as efficiently as possible.

(7) Inplace reverse a sentence 

You given a sentence of english words and spaces between them. 
Nothing crazy: 
1) no double spaces 
2) no empty words 
3) no spaces at the ends of a sentence


void inplace_reverse(char* arr, int length) {
    // your solution
}
Example: 
input "I wish you a merry Christmas" 
output "Christmas merry a you wish I" 

Constrains: O(1) additional memory

(8)Given a 4 X 4 game slot that has random alphabets in all the slots 
Write a function that takes the keyboard and the word as input and returns true if the word can be formed 
False otherwise. 

A word can be formed on the board by connecting alphabets adjacent to each other (horizontal, vertical and diagonally) 
Same alphabet should not be reused.


(9)You have a list of words with ranking. 
Now you need to create a function that will take this list as input and provide a way so that a T9 keyboard can provide three top results of probable words based on rankings for the numbers punched in.



(10)roll two dice, what is the probability of rolling no sixes?

(11)Find the maximum number of non-intersecting events in a calendar.



(12)Given an array of ages (integers) sorted lowest to highest, output the number of occurrences for each age. 
For instance: 
[8,8,8,9,9,11,15,16,16,16] 
should output something like: 
8: 3 
9: 2 
11: 1 
15: 1 
16: 3 

This should be done in less than O(n).

(13) An efficient way to sort patient files in an array of just 3 types 'High-importance', 'Mid-importance', 'Low-importance' which are in an arbitrary order (unsorted). 

The output preference should start with the highest. 

1. High-importance 

2. Mid-importance 

3. Low-importance 



[high,low,low,med,high,low] 

ps I was told to take advantage of the fact that they are just only 3 types.

(14)There is a list of rectangles and a list of points in a 2d space. Note that the edge of each rectangle are aligned to XY axis. question is how to find rectangles with point or points inside

(15)You are given an array of non-negative integers (0, 1, 2 etc). The value in each element represents the number of hops you may take to the next destination. Write a function that determines when you start from the first element whether you will be able to reach the last element of the array. 

if a value is 3, you can take either 0, 1, 2 or 3 hops. 

For eg: for the array with elements 1, 2, 0, 1, 0, 1, any route you take from the first element, you will not be able to reach the last element.

(16)Let's say there is a double square number X, which can be expressed as the sum of two perfect squares, for example, 10 is double square because 10 = 3^2 + 1^2 

Determine the number of ways which it can be written as the sum of two squares

(17)Suppose we have array of N numbers. We will define N functions on this array. Each function will return the sum of all numbers in the array from Li to Ri ( Li is left index, Ri is right index). Now we have 2 types of queries: 

Type1: 1 x y Change the xth element of the array to y 
Type2: 2 l r Return the sum of all functions from m to n. 

Input type: 
First Line is the size of the array i.e. N 

Next Line contains N space separated numbers Ai denoting the array 

Next N line follows denoting Li and Ri for each functions. 

Next Line contains an integer Q , number of queries to follow. 

Next Q line follows , each line containing a query of Type 1 or Type 2 

Here is an example: 
Input: 
5 
1 2 3 4 5 
1 2 
3 4 
1 4 
1 5 
3 5 
5 
1 1 5 
2 2 4 
2 1 3 
1 4 5 
2 1 5 

Output: 
40 
28 
63 

Explanation: 
Function 1 is sum of values from index 1 to index 2 = 1+2=3 
So , F1=3 
Similarly, F2=3+4=7 
F3=1+2+3+4=10 
F4=15 
F5=12 

Now when I query 1 1 5 
means it is type 1 query, so we replace value at index 1 by 5. 
So our new array is, 
5 2 3 4 5 
and 
F1=7 
F2=7(unchanged) 
F3=14 
F4=19 
F5=12(unchanged) 

Then next query is 2 2 4 
means give sum of all functions from index 2 to 4. 
So, ans= 7+14+19 =40 (output 1) 

Similarly are other 2 outputs. 
Index are 1 based in example. 
Comment me if you are not clear with question. 

Edit: I know one can do it with naive approach or using segment tree. But they wanted more faster way to do it.

(18)Suppose we are given a set L of n line segments in the plane, where the endpoints of each 
segment lie on the unit circle x^2 + y^2 = 1, and all 2n endpoints are distinct. Describe 
and analyze an algorithm to compute the largest subset of L in which no pair of segments 
intersects.

(19)You're given an array of integers(eg [3,4,7,1,2,9,8]) Find the index of values that satisfy A+B = C + D, where A,B,C & D are integers values in the array. 

Eg: Given [3,4,7,1,2,9,8] array 
The following 
3+7 = 1+ 9 satisfies A+B=C+D 
so print (0,2,3,5)



(20)Given an array of positive integers that represents possible points a team could score in an individual play. Now there are two teams play against each other. Their final scores are S and S'. How would you compute the maximum number of times the team that leads could have changed? 
For example, if S=10 and S'=6. The lead could have changed 4 times: 
Team 1 scores 2, then Team 2 scores 3 (lead change); 
Team 1 scores 2 (lead change), Team 2 score 0 (no lead change); 
Team 1 scores 0, Team 2 scores 3 (lead change); 
Team 1 scores 3, Team 2 scores 0 (lead change); 
Team 1 scores 3, Team 2 scores 0 (no lead change).

(21)Given an array of integers. We have to find the max element of the array, which is at multiple places in the array and return any one of the indices randomly.

(22)Given a function 

getRandomTripplet() 

which returns a random triplet of letters from a string. You don't know the string using calls to this function you have to correctly guess the string. the length of the string is also given. 

Lets say the string is helloworld the function getRandomTriplet will return things like 

hlo 
hew 
wld 
owo 

the function maintains the relative order of the letters. so it will never return

ohl since h is before o in the string. 
owe since w is after e 

The string is not known you are only given length of the string.

(23)Let's say you have 10,000 servers, each with a billion integers. How do you find the median?

(24)Implement a method called printNonComments() which prints out a extract of text with comments removed. 

For example, the input: 

hello /* this is a 
multi line comment */ all 

Should produce: 

hello 
all 

You have access to a method called getNextLine() which returns the next line in the input string.

(25)Code a function that receives a string composed by words separated by spaces and returns a string where words appear in the same order but than the original string, but every word is inverted. 
Example, for this input string


@"the boy ran"
the output would be


@"eht yob nar"
Tell the complexity of the solution.

(26)Design an HTTP downloader that caches results and doesn't block execution (i.e., enables simultaneous downloads).

(27)Code a function that receives an array with duplicates and returns a new array keeping the original order of the elements but with the duplicates removed. 

For example, if the input were


@[ @"dog", @"cat", @"dog", @"fish" ]
the output would be


@[ @"dog", @"cat", @"fish" ]
Tell the complexity of the solution.

(27)You want to create a staff to use in your martial arts training, and it has to meet some specific requirements. 

1. You want it to be composed of two smaller staves of equal length so that you can either use it as a single staff or as two smaller ones. 

2. You want the full sized staff's center of gravity to be exactly in the middle of the staff. 

You have a very, very long branch from which you can cut the pieces for your staff. The mass of the branch varies significantly throughout it, so you use just any two pieces of the same length. Given a description of the mass throughout the branch, determine the longest staff you can make, then return three integers on a single line, the first two indicating the first index of each half-staff, and the third indicating the length of each half-staff. 

The input will be given on a single line as a string of digits [1-9], each digit representing the mass of a section of the branch. All sections are the same size and the maximum length of the string is 500. Here is an example: 

41111921111119 
11119 11119 

If the indicated sections are cut from the branch they will satisfy your requirements. They are both the same length, and they can be put together as either 9111111119 or 1111991111, both of which have a center of gravity exactly in the center of the staff. 


Center of gravity can be determined by taking a weighted average of the mass of each section of the staff. Given the following distances and masses: 
Distance: 12345678 
Mass: 22241211 

Sum of the mass of each section: 2 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 15 
Weighted sum of the masses: 
2*1 + 2*2 + 2*3 + 4*4 + 1*5 + 2*6 + 1*7 + 1*8 = 60 
Weighted sum / regular sum = 60 / 15 = 4 

This means that the center of mass is in section 4 of the staff. If we wanted to use this staff the center of gravity would need to be (8+1)/2 = 4.5. 

Here is an example problem: 

131251141231 
---- ---- 

If we take the sections indicated we get 1312 and 1231. By reversing the first one and putting them together we get 21311231 

Sum of the mass of each section: 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 14 
Weight sum of the masses: 
2*1 + 1*2 + 3*3 + 1*4 + 1*5 + 2*6 + 3*7 + 1*8 = 63 
Weighted sum / regular sum = 63 / 14 = 4.5 

This puts the center of mass exactly in the center of the staff, for a perfectly balanced staff. There isn't a longer staff that can be made from this, so the answer to this problem is 

0 8 4 

Because the half-staves begin at indices 0 and 8 (in that order) and each is of length 4.

Additional requirements 
- you require that the data be quite fresh 
- how much storage will they take up 
- make sure this works for an active counter, getting 100s of events a second. 
- keep the implementation fast. E.g. under 10 mS. Or even better motivate by saying we might have 50 of these SMHD counters on a single status page, and ask the candidate how fast their solution should be.

(58)Mastermind is a game of two players. In the beginning, first player decides a secret key, which is a sequence (s1,s2,...sk) where 0 < si <= n, Then second player makes guesses in rounds, where each guess is of form (g1,g2, ...gk), and after each guess first player calculates the score for the guess. Score for a guess is equal to number of i's for which we have gi = si. 

For example if the secret key is (4,2,5,3,1) and the guess is (1,2,3,7,1),then the score is 2, because 
g2 = s2 and g5 = s5. 

Given a sequence of guesses, and scores for each guess, your program must decide if there exists at least one secret key that generates those exact scores. 

Input 

First line of input contains a single integer C (1 <=C <= 100). C test-cases follow. First line of each test-case contains three integers n,k and q. (1 <=n,k <=11, 1<=q<=8). Next q lines contain the guesses. 

Each guess consists of k integers gi,1, gi,2,....gi,k separated by a single space, followed by the score for the guess bi (1 <= gi,j<=n for all 1 <=i <=q, 1 <=j <=k; and 0 <= bi <=k ) 

Output 

For each test-case, output "Yes" (without quotes), if there exists at least a secret key which generates those exact scores, otherwise output "No". 

Sample Input 
2 

4 4 2 
2 1 2 2 0 
2 2 1 1 1 
4 4 2 
1 2 3 4 4

(80)An expression consisting of operands and binary operators can be written in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) by writing both the operands followed by the operator. For example, 3 + (4 * 5) can be written as "3 4 5 * +". 

You are given a string consisting of x's and *'s. x represents an operand and * represents a binary operator. It is easy to see that not all such strings represent valid RPN expressions. For example, the "x*x" is not a valid RPN expression, while "xx*" and "xxx**" are valid expressions. What is the minimum number of insert, delete and replace operations needed to convert the given string into a valid RPN expression? 

Input: The first line contains the number of test cases T. T test cases follow. Each case contains a string consisting only of characters x and *. 

Output: Output T lines, one for each test case containing the least number of operations needed. 

Constraints: 1 <= T <= 100 The length of the input string will be at most 100. 

Sample Input: 

5 
x

xx*xx** 
Sample Output: 

0 
0 
0 
2 
0 
Explanation: 

For the first three cases, the input expression is already a valid RPN, so the answer is 0. For the fourth case, we can perform one delete, and one insert operation: xx -> xx -> xx

(82)String Reduction 

Given a string consisting of a,b and c's, we can perform the following operation: Take any two adjacent distinct characters and replace it with the third character. For example, if 'a' and 'c' are adjacent, they can replaced with 'b'. What is the smallest string which can result by applying this operation repeatedly? 

Input: 
The first line contains the number of test cases T. T test cases follow. Each case contains the string you start with. 

Output: 
Output T lines, one for each test case containing the smallest length of the resultant string after applying the operations optimally. 

Constraints: 
1 <= T <= 100 
The string will have at most 100 characters. 

Sample Input: 
3 
cab 
bcab 
ccccc 

Sample Output: 
2 
1 
5 

Explanation: 
For the first case, you can either get cab -> cc or cab -> bb, resulting in a string of length 2. 
For the second case, one optimal solution is: bcab -> aab -> ac -> b. No more operations can be applied and the resultant string has length 1. 
For the third case, no operations can be performed and so the answer is 5.
