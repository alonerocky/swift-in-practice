(1) Design a hashMap in Java. Implement put, get, remove, resize methods.

(5)
Given a string s and a dictionary of words dict, determine if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words. 

For example, given 
s = "leetcode", 
dict = ["leet", "code"]. 

Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".

(8)
For a given string and dictionary, how many sentences can you make from the string, such that all the words are contained in the dictionary. 

// eg: for given string -> "appletablet" 
// "apple", "tablet" 
// "applet", "able", "t" 
// "apple", "table", "t" 
// "app", "let", "able", "t" 

// "applet", {app, let, apple, t, applet} => 3 
// "thing", {"thing"} -> 1

WAP to take one element from each of the array add it to the target sum. Print all those three-element combinations. 

/* 
A = [1, 2, 3, 3] 
B = [2, 3, 3, 4] 
C = [1, 2, 2, 2] 
target = 7 
*/ 

Result: 
[[1, 2, 4], [1, 3, 3], [1, 3, 3], [1, 3, 3], [1, 3, 3], [1, 4, 2], [2, 2, 3], [2, 2, 3], [2, 3, 2], [2, 3, 2], [3, 2, 2], [3, 2, 2]]



(9)
Given string a and b, with b containing all distinct characters, find the longest common subsequence's 

length. Expected complexity O(nlogn).



(10)
Given a 4*n block, find number of different ways of filling it with 1*2 smaller blocks. Rotation of smaller blocks is allowed.



(11)
Given an array of numbers, for every index i, find nearest index j such that a[j] > a[i].If such an index doesn’t exist for i, ­1 should be printed.



(12)
Given a character limit and a message, split the message up into annotated chunks without cutting words as, for example when sending the SMS "Hi Sivasrinivas, your Uber is arriving now!" with char limit 25, you should get 
["Hi Sivasrinivas,(1/3)", "your Uber is arriving(2/3)", "now!(3/3)"]




(14)
Add a third dimension of time to a hashmap , so ur hashmap will look something like this - HashMap<K, t, V> where t is a float value. Implement the get and put methods to this map. The get method should be something like - map.get(K,t) which should give us the value. If t does not exists then map should return the closest t' such that t' is smaller than t. For example, if map contains (K,1,V1) and (K,2,V2) and the user does a get(k,1.5) then the output should be v1 as 1 is the next smallest number to 1.5

From where does Twitter get the information for a particular trend(Eg: #Obama, #nfl) and publish it out? What protocol does it use? How do you connect to Twitter API? How does Twitter handle multiple connections?
